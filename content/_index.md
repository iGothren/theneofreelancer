# About Me
Hi, I’m [_G. Carvalho_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavo-carvalho-54b43a363/), a **high school student** passionate about **technology**, **competitive mathematics**, and **freelancing**.

I’m diving into **full-stack web development**, **multimedia design**, and exploring online business ventures like **affiliate marketing and dropshipping**.

This blog is where I share my journey, projects, and insights. As a self-taught developer with a knack for problem-solving—honed through winning **_gold_ and _silver medals_ at a Brazilian Math Olympiad ([_OBMEP_](http://obmep.org.br/estudos.htm))** — I’m excited to create and share projects that make an impact.
