# Hey! 👋  
**I’m a high school student working to enter the freelancing world — starting with blogging, vibe-coding, and smart tools like AI.**

This site is just a playground and portfolio — a space to test and show what I can do.

🛠️ I’m still a beginner, but I’m consistent, curious, and willing to work hard.

🧠 Every project here is part of my journey to turn learning into impact.

👉 Check out my [blog](/posts), learn [more about me](/about), or [get in touch](/contact)!
