Welcome to my first public project!</span> I plan to use it as a base to share a demo of my work. It’s all a work in progress — and that’s the point!

This page was built using Hugo, by adapting page templates and leveraging AI — mostly ChatGPT — which are the very tools I’m exploring and eager to use in the freelancing world. Everything here is a product of hands-on practice and curiosity.
